The reason there is a counting problem is because some tweets appear twice. This happens when a user retweets another users tweet.
Here is an example of a tweet that appears twice in the dataset: "After the 'genocide' remark from San Juan Mayor the narrative has changed though. @CNN fixes it's reporting constantly."
You can identify these retweets by verifying the "retweet" column. The original tweet is marked with 0 whereas the retweet is 1.
